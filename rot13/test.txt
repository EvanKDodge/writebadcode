The methodology behind frequency analysis relies on the fact that in any language, each letter has its own personality. The most obvious trait that letters have is the frequency with which they appear in a language. Clearly in English the letter "Z" appears far less frequently than, say, "A". In times gone by, if you wanted to find out the frequencies of letters within a language, you had to find a large piece of text and count each frequency. Now, however, we have computers that can do the hard work for us. But in fact, we don't even need to do this step, as for most languages there are databases of the letter frequencies, which have been calculated by looking at millions of texts, and are thus very highly accurate.
From these databases we find that "E" is the most common letter in English, appearing about 12% of the time (that is just over one in ten letters is an "E"). The next most common letter is "T" at 9%. The full frequency list is given by the graph below.
