UI
-------------

- STOP trying to improve performance!!!

- What do we want to display?
-- Registers - A, D, PC - DONE
-- RAM/ROM - current address only - DONE
-- Screen (probably separate raylib window for this) - DONE
--- This is slow. Try updating a texture and copying to screen - DONE

-- ** Contents of keyboard "register" (0x6000)
-- List contents of RAM - DONE
--- Editable
-- List contents of ROM - DONE
--- Flip between ASM and Hack? (or just show both?)
