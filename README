I'm creating this repository to hold the bad code that I write.

I've been trying to figure out (for too long) which book, which tutorial, or which video would be the best to help me improve my skills. The truth is it doesn't matter if I don't write any code.

Furthermore, perfection is the enemy of progress. I need to get comfortable with writing bad code. The hope is, if I get all of the bad code out of me, I might start writing some good code. We'll see what happens.
